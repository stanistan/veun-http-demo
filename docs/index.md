# veun-http-demo

_This is a demo server using the [veun][veun] library._

---

## What is this?

The server itself is being implemented a "[literate
programming][lit-prog]" style, the documentation below
_is_ the code to run what you're currently seeing on the
this website.

Unlike a tutorial, this documentation is meant to be traversed
more like _code_ and is attempting to demonstrate the live
state of a program and why it is the way it is vs the steps
it took to construct it.

_This is a work in progress._
